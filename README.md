## Is the Biontech vaccine useful for the coronavirus?

### Introduction

As everyone knows, the whole world has been under the influence of the coronavirus since 2019 and is fighting to end the pandemic. Various vaccines have been developed and used to stop this virus. The vaccine I'm examining in this study is the BionTech vaccine.

In order to confirm the claims that the BionTech vaccine reduces the spread of coronavirus, the change in the number of cases before and after vaccination was examined with the Two-Sample T Test in this study.

### Exploring Dataset

On 26.05.2021, large amounts of BionTech vaccines began to arrive in Turkey, and almost all the public became able to get the Biontech vaccine whenever they wanted. Before this date, a certain number of BionTech vaccines had come to Turkey, but they were administered only to certain people (doctors, etc.). Therefore, we can ignore this minority.

The data set we use is the number of coronavirus cases in Turkey between 26.04.2021 and 26.06.2021. The data between 26.04.2021 and 26.05.2021 were determined as the cases that occurred before the BionTech vaccine, and the data between 26.05.2021 and 26.06.2021 were determined as the cases that occurred after the BionTech vaccine, and investigations were carried out in this context.

### Two Sample T Test

Two-sample t-test (also known as independent samples t-test) is a method used to test whether there is a certain difference between two groups. A two-sample t-test is used to analyze the results from A/B tests.
